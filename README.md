## **PROJECT CODE AND NAME** 

**Code:** HQSCP-2026 **Name:** Housing Quality & Safety Certification Program

## **DESCRIPTION**

## Finding a rental apartment is stressful enough, but for students and newcomers, it often comes with an extra layer of risk: misleading listings, hidden mold or structural issues, and landlords who vanish after you sign. There is currently no easy way for a renter to know whether an apartment is actually safe and livable before moving in.

This project builds a certification program that solves exactly that. We want to develop a system where apartments can be inspected and certified by trained, independent inspectors, and listed in a public online registry that anyone can check before renting. 

The program starts in one city (pilot), focused on student housing, and expands to other cities once the model is proven.
