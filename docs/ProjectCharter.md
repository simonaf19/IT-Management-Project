## **PROJECT CODE AND NAME** 

**Code:** HQSCP-2026 **Name:** Housing Quality & Safety Certification Program

## **DESCRIPTION**

Finding a rental apartment is stressful enough, but for students and newcomers, it often comes with an extra layer of risk: misleading listings, hidden mold or structural issues, and landlords who vanish after you sign. There is currently no easy way for a renter to know whether an apartment is actually safe and livable before moving in.

This project builds a certification program that solves exactly that. We want to develop a system where apartments can be inspected and certified by trained, independent inspectors, and listed in a public online registry that anyone can check before renting. 

The program starts in one city (pilot), focused on student housing, and expands to other cities once the model is proven.

## **PROJECT CLIENT** 

**Contracting Authority:** University of Primorska  
**Internal Client:** Head of Student Housing  
**Possible partners:** Municipality of Koper, Student Organization of UP, and real estate agencies.

## **THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS ENVIRONMENT** 

The project strengthens the University’s credibility and supports student welfare by improving transparency in the rental market. Certified properties gain a competitive advantage, encouraging landlords to improve standards. The program increases safety for tenants and contributes to higher overall housing quality in the region.

## **THE PURPOSE AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT** 

**Purpose:** Build a working certification system for rental apartments: from inspection standards to a public registry of verified properties.

**Objectives:**

* Define clear safety and habitability criteria for rental housing  
* Train independent housing inspectors  
* Launch a public online registry of certified properties  
* Certify at least 200 apartments in the pilot city within 12 months  
* Expand to 3 additional cities by month 24

## **POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACTING AUTHORITY:**

**a) Description of the finished product, service or result**

The project will deliver:

**b) Reporting and final report**
