**Persona 2: Matjaž Horvat** 

**Function**  
Independent landlord 

**Screening Question**:  
Do you rent out one or more apartments independently (without a real estate agency), and have you ever experienced distrust or misunderstandings with tenants regarding apartment quality?

**Description:**  
Matjaž is a 45-year-old landlord living in Koper. He works full-time as an electrician and rents out an apartment inherited from his parents as an additional source of income. It is located near the University of Primorska, so he rents it out to students. He manages his apartment alone, posting listings online, arranging viewings after work hours, and handling repairs himself whenever possible to save money.

He considers himself fair and responsible, but thinks that the rental market has become stressful. He often feels frustrated because tenants are increasingly suspicious due to scams and poor housing conditions elsewhere in the market, and he has no objective way of proving his apartment’s quality. 

A previous tenant complained about humidity problems and accused him of renting an unsafe apartment. Although the issue was later linked to ventilation habits, this conflict caused stress and made Matjaž worried about legal disputes and damage to his reputation. 

Matjaž wants to present his apartment as well-maintained, but lacks an objective way to prove housing quality before signing contracts.

| Problem Scenario 1 | Current Alternatives | Pitfalls of current solutions | Our solution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Matjaž lists his apartment online, but struggles to convince potential tenants that his apartment is safe and well-maintained. This leads to hesitation, repeated questions, and slower rental agreements. | Matjaž provides photos and allows apartment visits to demonstrate quality. | Tenants may still not trust listings or assume problems are hidden. Visits take time, and safety conditions may be overlooked. | Through the Housing Quality & Safety Certification Program, Matjaž can obtain an official certification. His apartment would appear in a public registry, allowing tenants to verify housing quality, increasing trust and reducing uncertainty. |
| | Matjaž asks previous tenants to provide references or positive feedback about the apartment. | Testimonials are subjective and may not be trusted by new tenants, since they are not verified and may appear biased. | |
