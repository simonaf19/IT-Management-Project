**Persona 1: Antonio Gonzalez**

**Function:**  
Tentant

**Screening Question**: Have you had to find housing on your own, and if so, did you have any hidden problems with it that were hidden or unclear before signing a contract?

**Description:**  
Antonio is a 20-year-old international student from Argentina. Currently lives in Koper with his girlfriend. Has a part-time job at a help desk in a local museum. Antonio is a calm young man with a cheerful personality, who prioritises comfort and convenience. Prefers to walk everywhere and enjoys spending quiet evenings reading. Is allergic to mold. He had a bad experience before when his landlord hid the fact that the building has black mold problem, which led to Antonio having sleep and breathing problems due to his allergy. The landlord later accused him of damaging the property, even though the damage was caused by extensively grown black mold under the wallpapers caused by the age of the building. 

Antonio stated that they would be willing to overpay for a newer apartment rather than take one from an old building, since it is hard to know potential pitfalls that are frequently understated or hidden by landlords, if they even are aware of those problems in the first place. However, it is a difficult decision for them in terms of budget; they are hesitant to just opt out.

| Problem Scenario 1 | Current Alternatives | Pitfalls of current solutions | Our solution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Antonio finds a nice-looking apartment for a small price, but he is afraid of it having hidden mold that will cause him to have sleep and breathing problems again. | Antonio can ask landlords about potential mold problems. | Highly dependent on the honesty of the landlord or their being aware of mold problems. | Antonio would be able to look up buildings of apartments that he is interested in our database and see all potential problems with it, which he can later ask about from landlords. Alternatively, if housing is not tracked by the service, Antonio can browse already tracked housing and look for available places that satisfy his needs. |
|  | Antonio can hire a real estate agent from an agency that can investigate or search for potential housing that satisfies their needs for an additional cost. | Adds additional costs on top of the price of contract signage, which can be over their budget. |  |
|  | Antonio can try to look for potential signs of mold during apartment viewing. | Sometimes mold problems could be hidden and difficult to detect at first sight in a short period of time. |  |

| Problem Scenario 2 | Current Alternatives | Pitfalls of current solutions | Our solution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Antonio finds an apartment that looks clean, but the landlord refuses to allow an independent inspection before signing the contract, claiming it is unnecessary. | Antonio accepts the condition and signs the contract to avoid losing the apartment. | By signing without inspection, Antonio risks having serious health, financial, and legal problems if hidden mold issues emerge later. | If the apartment is certified within the Housing Quality & Safety Certification Program, Antonio can access verified inspection results, including humidity assessments and ventilation compliance. This reduces uncertainty without requiring personal negotiation or risking unfavorable contract terms. |
|  | Antonio requests a short-term rental period before committing to a long-term contract. | A short-term contract may come with a higher rent, or mold problems may not become visible. |  |


**Persona 2: Matjaž Horvat** 

**Function**  
Independent landlord 

**Screening Question**:  
Do you rent out one or more apartments independently (without a real estate agency), and have you ever experienced distrust or misunderstandings with tenants regarding apartment quality?

**Description:**  
Matjaž is a 45-year-old landlord living in Koper. He works full-time as an electrician and rents out an apartment inherited from his parents as an additional source of income. It is located near the University of Primorska, so he rents it out to students. He manages his apartment alone, posting listings online, arranging viewings after work hours, and handling repairs himself whenever possible to save money.

He considers himself fair and responsible, but thinks that the rental market has become stressful. He often feels frustrated because tenants are increasingly suspicious due to scams and poor housing conditions elsewhere in the market, and he has no objective way of proving his apartment’s quality. 

A previous tenant complained about humidity problems and accused him of renting an unsafe apartment. Although the issue was later linked to ventilation habits, this conflict caused stress and made Matjaž worried about legal disputes and damage to his reputation. 

Matjaž wants to present his apartment as well-maintained, but lacks an objective way to prove housing quality before signing contracts.

| Problem Scenario 1 | Current Alternatives | Pitfalls of current solutions | Our solution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Matjaž lists his apartment online, but struggles to convince potential tenants that his apartment is safe and well-maintained. This leads to hesitation, repeated questions, and slower rental agreements. | Matjaž provides photos and allows apartment visits to demonstrate quality. | Tenants may still not trust listings or assume problems are hidden. Visits take time, and safety conditions may be overlooked. | Through the Housing Quality & Safety Certification Program, Matjaž can obtain an official certification. His apartment would appear in a public registry, allowing tenants to verify housing quality, increasing trust and reducing uncertainty. |
| | Matjaž asks previous tenants to provide references or positive feedback about the apartment. | Testimonials are subjective and may not be trusted by new tenants, since they are not verified and may appear biased. | |

 **Persona 3: Nina Kovač**

 **Function:**

Municipal housing officer (public administration stakeholder)

 **Screening Question:**

Are you responsible for handling housing complaints, monitoring rental conditions, or overseeing housing regulation compliance within your municipality?

 **Description:**

Nina is a 38-year-old municipal housing officer working in the city administration of Koper. She has a background in public policy and urban development and has been working in the housing department for over ten years. Nina is organized, analytical, and highly aware of how housing quality affects public health and student well-being. She dresses professionally, prefers structured processes, and relies heavily on documentation and formal procedures.

Her department frequently receives complaints from tenants about mold, poor ventilation, electrical hazards, and unclear rental conditions. However, these complaints usually come after damage has already occurred. Nina often feels frustrated because her work is reactive rather than preventive. She lacks a centralized system that would allow her to monitor housing quality proactively or track recurring issues in specific buildings.

She believes that the municipality should have clearer housing standards and measurable quality indicators, but currently, there is no unified framework that connects landlords, tenants, and public authorities. Nina wants a structured, transparent system that reduces disputes, improves housing standards, and minimizes administrative workload.

| Thinks | Nina believes housing problems could be prevented with clearer standards and better monitoring. She thinks reactive complaint handling is inefficient and that decisions should be based on measurable data. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Sees** | She sees recurring complaints about mold, humidity, and safety risks. She observes a lack of centralized data and repeated conflicts between tenants and landlords. |
| **Feels** | Nina feels frustrated that her work is mostly reactive. She feels responsible for public safety but limited by insufficient tools and structured information. |
| **Does** | She reviews complaints, organizes inspections, documents cases, and prepares reports for supervisors. Much of her time is spent resolving disputes after problems have already occurred. |

| Problem Scenario 1 | Current Alternatives | Pitfalls of current solutions | Our solution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nina receives repeated complaints about unsafe living conditions in the same building, but there is no centralized database that shows previous inspections or patterns of recurring issues. | Nina organizes a manual inspection after receiving each complaint. | Manual inspections require significant time and staff resources and cannot be conducted proactively for all properties. | A public Housing Quality and Safety Certification Registry would provide inspection history, certification validity, and documented issues for each property, enabling preventive monitoring and early identification of recurring risks. |
|  | Nina issues warnings or fines if violations are confirmed. | Fines are reactive and do not prevent similar issues from occurring again in the future. |  |

| Problem Scenario 2 | Current Alternatives | Pitfalls of current solutions | Our solution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nina is asked by her supervisor to provide a report on housing quality trends, but she lacks measurable standards and reliable market-wide data. | Nina compiles complaint records from internal spreadsheets and past case files. | The data is fragmented, incomplete, and reflects only reported cases rather than the overall condition of the housing market. | A standardized Housing Quality and Safety Certification system with annual inspections and a centralized digital registry would provide Nina with measurable, comparable data across properties. This would allow her to prepare evidence-based reports, identify recurring risks, and support preventive housing policies with objective metrics. |
|  | Nina conducts occasional surveys to estimate housing satisfaction levels. | Survey responses are irregular, voluntary, and may not accurately reflect structural safety or hidden issues. |  |
